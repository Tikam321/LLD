ðŸš€ About This Repository

This repository contains my Low-Level Design (LLD), machine coding, and design pattern practice projects.
Iâ€™m continuously learning and improving my skills by implementing real-world system designs, refining architecture, and following clean coding principles.

ðŸ’¡ Key Focus Areas
	â€¢	Building scalable and maintainable systems
	â€¢	Applying design patterns effectively
	â€¢	Practicing problem-solving and architectural thinking
	â€¢	Iteratively improving projects based on feedback and learning

If you want, I can also add a more structured README with:
	â€¢	Table of contents
	â€¢	Project list with links
	â€¢	Tech stack badges
	â€¢	Setup instructions
